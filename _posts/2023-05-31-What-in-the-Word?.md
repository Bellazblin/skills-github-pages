What is article?

In Cognitive Grammar, articles are analyzed in terms of their semantic and cognitive properties. Definite articles, such as "the" in English or "der/die/das" in German, are associated with referents that are assumed to be identifiable to both the speaker and the hearer. Indefinite articles, such as "a" or "an" in English or "ein/eine" in German, introduce referents that are not assumed to be identifiable or specific in the discourse.

Furthermore, Cognitive Grammar emphasizes the role of prototypes and radial categories in the interpretation of articles. For example, in English, the definite article "the" is typically used with prototypical or highly salient referents, while indefinite articles are used with less salient or non-prototypical referents.

Cognitive Grammar also recognizes that the use and interpretation of articles can be influenced by contextual factors, such as the speaker's knowledge, the hearer's expectations, and the discourse coherence.
